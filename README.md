 RESTAURANT PIZZA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

 #Project Description
 The Restaurant Pizza Management System is a Flask-based web application that allows users to manage information about restaurants and their pizza's.

Restaurant Management: Users can add new restaurants, view existing restaurants, and delete restaurants. Each restaurant has a name and an address with each having a different id.

Pizza Management: Users can add new pizza types, view existing pizza types, and delete pizza types. Each pizza has a name and a list of ingredients and each also has different id.

Restaurant-Pizza Associations: Users can create associations between restaurants and pizza types, including setting prices for specific pizzas at specific restaurants. This allows users to manage the menu offerings for each restaurant individually and without clogging together the data .

Database Integration: The application uses a SQLite database to store information about restaurants, pizzas, and their relationships.
